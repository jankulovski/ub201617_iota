## Motivation

Implement a genetic algorithm to evolve agents that move through a hilly terrain. <br/>
The terrain is a 2-dimensional array where the value of each cell represents the height.<br/>
Agents can only move forward or backward and turn left or right.<br/>
As the agents execute moves, the move_counter increases depending on the difference in height between the starting and ending cell.<br/>
The agents can also perform tests and execute moves depending on the result.<br/>
Define N possible movement commands and number them 0-N.<br/>
Their goal is to cover as much ground as possible with the given number of moves.<br/>

A typical genetic algorithm can be defined with following:

- Generates a population of points at each iteration. The best individual in the population approaches an optimal solution.<br/>
- Selects the next population by evolving the current population using crossover and mutation functions.<br/>
- Every individual have its own fitness evaluation function which defines his efficiency in the given domain.<br/>
- Fitness function is used in evolution of the population.<br/>
- Is using predefined thresholds such population size, number of iterations, tournament size, mutation rate etc.<br/>

## Implementation

Genetic algorithm [evolution.py](hill/evolution.py):
- Generating first population of agents with random program for each agent contained of commands/actions. <br/>
- Each agent of the population runs on his terrain with the predefined program and compute his own fitness function based on the actions and costs. 
Agent executes actions until he runs out of Money `move_counter` or out of steps `Max iterations` . Money are deducted depending on the difference in height between his current and next cell.<br/>
- In next step the average fitness function is computed for the population and the best agent is chosen based on the fitness function.
- After the average fitness and best agent is selected new population is generated using the `crossover` function and `mutation` function.

## Project classes and definitions

Predefined thresholds that can be changed [Initialization.py](hill/initialization.py):<br/>
- Max iterations<br/>
- Money<br/>
- Population size<br/>
- Num of generation<br/>
- Tournament size<br/>
- Mutation rate<br/>
- Hill(terrain)<br/>

Agents are defined as objects with following attributes [Agent class](hill/simulator.py):
- Commands 
```
CMDS = [
"nop()",
"move_forward()",
"move_backward()",
"turn_left()",
"turn_right()",
"set_flag()",
"clear_flag()",
"mark_position()",
"unmark_position()"]
```
```
TESTS = [
"coverage_improved()",
"can_move_forward",
"can_move_backward",
"marked_ahead",
"marked_behind",
"marked_current",
"flag"]
```
- Program - Random generated commands
- Terrain or Hill (in 2D)
- Max moves allowed
- Money or Cost
- Fitness

Every Agent can do series of commands under 2D terrain and each cell in that terrain holds its own height as value. Terrains can be found in [hills folder - hill_*.txt](hill/hills). They are randomly generated by [generator.py](hill/generator.py). <br/>
Fitness function of every command performed by the agent is computed depending on the difference in height between his current and his next state. <br/>
Fitness function is defined in [simulator.py - Agent class](hill/simulator.py).
